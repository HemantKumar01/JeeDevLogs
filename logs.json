Currently i am getting ranks near 150 in allen jee advanced tests. I want to escalate them to <= 10 rank before JEE Advanced. There are about 40 days for JEE Advanced and my goal is to get rank <=10 in JEE Advanced."},{"timestamp":"24/4/2023 23:22","text":"Today, a large part of my time (2.5 hr) is spent in creating this thing. Still hoping that it's worth it. \r\n\r\nToday's Progress is that i was able to complete all GRPs for 1 day. However i was not able to Dq them or tests that i have given in last 2 days. Tomorrow's goal will be to get Rating Score of 55. \r\n\r\nAn upcoming danger is Vaishnavy is coming back. She can be a big trouble as she is a fool and thinks of nothing. So, I will try to get away from any arguments and will try to waste no time."},{"timestamp":"26/4/2023 0:38","text":"Completed all GRPs of today. Also did first DQ of all yesterday's GRP. Still can't complete any JAdv test DQ. Went to sleep late (12:36), because of Chem GRP and JEE Mains Final Results(which is still not released).\r\n\r\nTomorrow's goal will be to do 2 hr JAdv Dq along with today's equivalent work."}]}
