Still hoping that it's worth it. \r\n\r\nToday's Progress is that i was able to complete all GRPs for 1 day. However i was not able to Dq them or tests that i have given in last 2 days. Tomorrow's goal will be to get Rating Score of 55. \r\n\r\nAn upcoming danger is Vaishnavy is coming back. She can be a big trouble as she is a fool and thinks of nothing. So, I will try to get away from any arguments and will try to waste no time."
